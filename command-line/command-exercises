## 1: Basics

### 1.1 Running a terminal

#### Exercise: 2

Q: By examining the menu items for your terminal program, figure out how to create a new tab.

Extra credit: Learn the keyboard shortcut for creating a new tab.

A: 'Command + t'

---

## 1.2: Our first command

### Exercise: 1

Q: Write a command that prints out the string “hello, world”. Extra credit: As in Listing 1, do it two different ways, both with and without using quotation marks.

A: 'echo "Hello World"',
'echo hello, world'

### Exercise: 2

Q: Type the command echo ’hello (with a mismatched single quote), and then get out of trouble using the technique from Box 4.

A: 'echo 'hello" 'ctrl - C'

## 1.3 Man pages

### Exercise: 1
Q: According to the man page, what is the official short and long description of echo on your system?

A: Short: 'write arguments to the standard output'
  Long: DESCRIPTION
The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
(` ') characters and followed by a newline (`\n') character, to the standard output.

### Exercise: 2
Q: By reading the man page for echo, determine the command needed to print out “hello” without the trailing newline, and verify using your terminal that it works as expected.

A: 'echo -n ['hello']'

## 1.4 Editing the line

### Exercise: 1

Q: Using the up arrow, print to the screen the strings “fee”, “fie”, “foe”, and “fum” without retyping echo each time.

A: `echo fee`
    up `fie`
    up `foe`
    up `fum`

### Exercise: 2
Q: Starting with the line in Listing 4, use any combination of Ctrl-A, Ctrl-E, arrow keys, or Option-click to change the occurrences of the short s to the archaic long s “ſ” in order to match the appearance of the original (Figure 10).

A: Up arrow to pull command down, then utilized Option-click to select and edit the 's'

## 1.5: Cleaning up

### Exercise: 1
Q: Clear the contents of the current tab.

A: 'ctrl -d' = exit
  'ctrl -l' = clear

### Exercise: 2
Q: Open a new tab, execute echo ’hello’, and then exit.

A: echo "hello"
  'ctrl-d'

### 1.6: Summary

### Exercise: 1

Q: Write a command to print the string Use "man echo", including the quotes; i.e., take care not to print out Use man echo instead.

A: echo 'use "man echo"'

### Exercise: 2
Q: By running man sleep, figure out how to make the terminal “sleep” for 5 seconds, and execute the command to do so. After waiting the requisite 5 seconds, execute the command to sleep for 5000 seconds, realize that’s well over an hour, and then use the instructions from Box 4 to get out of trouble.

A: Theres is two ways to achieve this. either
"sleep 5s" or "sleep 5"
"sleep 5000s" or "sleep 5000" to escape 'ctrl-c'

#2: Manipulating files

## 2.1: Redirecting and appending

### Exercise: 1

Q: Using echo and >, make files called line_1.txt and line_2.txt containing the first and second lines of Sonnet 1, respectively.

A: echo 'From fairest creatures we desire increase,'> line_1.text,
echo 'That thereby beauty's rose might never die,'> line_2.txt

### Exercise: 2

Q: Replicate the original sonnet_1.txt (containing the first two lines of the sonnet) by first redirecting the contents of line_1.txt and then appending the contents of line_2.txt. Call the new file sonnet_1_copy.txt, and confirm using diff that it’s identical to sonnet_1.txt.

A: echo "form fairest creatures we desire increse,"> sonnet_1. txt ;
echo 'that thereby beauty's rose might never die.'>> sonnet_1_lower_case.txt;
diff sonnet_1.txt sonnet_1_lower_case.txt

### Exercise 3

Q: Use cat to combine the contents of line_1.txt and line_2.txt in reverse order using a single command, yielding the file sonnet_1_reversed.txt.

A: cat line_2.txt line_1.txt > sonnet_1_reversed.txt

---
## 2.2: Listing

### Exercise 1

Q: What’s the command to list all the files (and directories) that start with the letter “s”?

A: 'ls s*'

### Exercise 2

Q: What is the command to list all the files that contain the string “onnet”, long-form by reverse modification time?

A: 'ls -r-l-t *onnet*'
or "ls - rlt *onnet*"

### Exercise 3

Q: What is the command to list all files (including hidden ones) by reverse modification time, in long form?

A: 'ls -a -rtl'
or 'ls -artl'

## 2.3: Renaming, copying, deleting

### Exercise 1
Q: Use the echo command and the redirect operator > to make a file called foo.txt containing the text “hello, world”. Then, using the cp command, make a copy of foo.txt called bar.txt. Using the diff command, confirm that the contents of both files are the same.

A: step 1.
'echo "hello world" > foo.txt'
   step 2.
'cp foo.txt bar.txt'
   step 3.
diff foo.txt bar.txt

### Exercise 2

Q: By combining the cat command and the redirect operator >, create a copy of foo.txt called baz.txt without using the cp command.

A: cat foo.txt > baz.txt

### Exercise 3

Q: Create a file called quux.txt containing the contents of foo.txt followed by the contents of bar.txt.

A: 'cat fooo.txt bar.txt > quux.txt'

###Exercise 4

Q: How do rm nonexistent and rm -f nonexistent differ for a nonexistent file?

A: 'rm' requests confirmation before removal.
'rm -f' no confirmation required

## 2.4: Summary

Q: By copying and pasting the text from the HTML version of Figure 15,
use echo to make a file called sonnet_1_complete.txt containing the full (original) text of Shakespeare’s first sonnet.

A:' full sonnet....' > sonnet_1_complete.txt

Q: Type the sequence of commands needed to create an empty file called foo, rename it to bar, and copy it to baz.

A:
step 1.'touch foo'
step 2. 'mv foo bar'
staep 3. 'cp bar baz'

### Exercise 3

Q: What is the command to list only the files starting with the letter “b”?

A: 'ls b*'

### Exercise 4

Q: Remove both bar and baz using a single call to rm.

A: 'rm ba*'
