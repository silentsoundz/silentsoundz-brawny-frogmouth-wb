QueenBey="Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves"

QueenBey2="I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, Don't move
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new"

QueenBey3="I'm telling these tears, Go and fall away, fall away
May the last one burn into flames"
